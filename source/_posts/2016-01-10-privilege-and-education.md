TL;DR: Especially in the US, discriminated groups lack *equal opportunities* to
succeed at the *meritocracy* game. But to fix that, you should fix *public
education* and the *welfare state* through *social democracy* to provide *equal
opportunities*, instead of using *this argument* to attack the principle of
meritocracy, or even the idea of merit and talent. I'm an European social
democrat that cares about Social Justice, I'm looking at (US) Social Justice
Activism, and I'm not happy with lots that I see.

To oversimplify: apparently Silicon Valley IT companies hire few programmers
from minorities, for instance because they hire programmers
[from top-tier schools](https://modelviewculture.com/pieces/the-top-10-tech-rules),
and it's harder to get there if your parents aren't rich (thus white). So, what
about we fight to get minorities better education? And since it's harder to
educate adults, we should really fix public schools:

- Schools in poor areas are so underfunded they can't prepare most people for
  college.
- Somehow, schools overall get fewer women to Computer Science and other STEM
  subjects, to a degree varying with the country. It's still education's job to
  fix that. More specifically, we don't have a consensus on why that happens.

  I believe  should try to
  That's a much more complex topic. I won't try to sum up research on
  why that is.

  but I still believe it's
  education's job to fix that.

let's take an hypothetical *average* black kid from a ghetto. Apparently

unfortunately less likely to get a job at Google, not by his fault. That's
unfair. Ultimately, that's because he's black and from a ghetto, so (on average)
he got worse education and has a worse CV. *But* he

and a white kid from a rich neighborhood have
equal opportunities if only the second got education worth of this name?

Children of affluent families get better education and have thus advantages.

In particular,
To oversimplify,



For concreteness, look at how Model View Culture discusses the
[*"myth" of the 10x developer*](https://modelviewculture.com/pieces/hacker-mythologies-and-mismanagement).
Compare [more](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/a/181297/21277)
[impartial discussions](http://www.construx.com/10x_Software_Development/Origins_of_10X_%E2%80%93_How_Valid_is_the_Underlying_Research_/).
To summarize: Model View Culture claims that the idea of the 10x developer is a
myth used as instrument of oppression, and points out flaws in the studies.
However, there are in fact multiple studies, they are among the most rigorous
studies in Software Engineering, and there are zero academic rebuttals. The
flaws might call for further research or for skepticism, but that does not mean
concluding the opposite of what studies show.

[Another piece](https://modelviewculture.com/pieces/the-top-10-tech-rules)
claims that if you come from a top-tier school or have a better CV, you have an
advantage when interviewing, and this does not increase diversity. But could,
well, top-tier schools actually be better, instead of just being a proof of
status?
[The Economist](http://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21640316-children-rich-and-powerful-are-increasingly-well-suited-earning-wealth-and-power)
suggests exactly this, and explains this creates a more complicated problems.
[In another article](http://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21646990-ideas-delivering-equity-well-excellence-having-it-all),
they suggest spending money to get poor kids to good schools, as in Australia and other countries.

[Yet another Model View Culture post](https://modelviewculture.com/pieces/programmer-legitimacy-earned-bought-or-borrowed).
points out correctly that non-college programming education also does not offer equal opportunities.
They also point out that many educators are programmers, not teachers, thus not
qualified enough.
However, they never mention public education.

and a kid from Manhattan ever have equal opportunities to learn
programming as adults, if the Bronx kid

While effective
public education in the US appears unlikely in the short term, you can't provide
equal opportunities without it.

Since I'm a Computer Science
PhD student,

I come from the European Left
Wing, and I'm here to rant on this practice of the US Left Wing.

Alternatively: I'm Left Wing, I read to Paul Graham, and most attacks on him
miss the point. I don't want him to run a country, but he should keep doing
(most of) what he's doing. Yes, he's confused, but lots of comments are worse.

Say that
[Paul Graham points out that if you can't communicate in English, in practice you do worse in the US as a startup founder](http://www.paulgraham.com/accents.html).
I don't see a campaign for better English teaching for immigrants, but I see a
campaign attacking this comment as xenophobic. I used to speak with a bad
Italian accent; I talked to people and they told me to send emails instead. That
wasn't xenophobic.

See biased attacks on the *10x programmer myth*, versus the
[actual controversy](http://www.construx.com/10x_Software_Development/Origins_of_10X_%E2%80%93_How_Valid_is_the_Underlying_Research_/).

Disclaimers: I am only a left-wing European Computer Science PhD student, not a
sociology, hence an informed outsider. Regarding my Privilege: I am white, male,
cis, hetero, but I grew up bullied as nerd, my family is far from rich and I
grew up and studied in Sicily.

Women, minorities and generally poors are unfairly disadvantaged in life,
especially in the US, and boy that sucks. But the contemporary US Left culture
focuses on fixing this problem at the wrong place, and I'm tired of that. Lots
of talk about *privilege* focuses on that. Especially I'm tired of people
attacking the idea of meritocracy in the wrong way. I'm so tired I'm ranting on
this.

Yes, meritocracy doesn't fully work in the US. Yes, in some cases, you can
succeed from little through hard work and talent—that's *meritocracy*—but not
all can develop their potential into talent, because society fails *educating*
them. Worse, if you don't succeed, you don't even get a decent life, because of
*social inequality*, and people treat you like shit, because of the *American
meritocracy myth*. Again, this sucks. But it should be fixed correctly.

However, lots argue that *meritocracy* per
se is unfair.

but completely forget that (2) and (3) are worse. In
fact, while I talk about talent, some are so angry about the whole story that
they try to deny talent.

That's what should be fixed. And it should be fixed through

if you grow in a First World country.
I contend that's not
the case

in a First World country.

If you are part of a minority

You fix it through schools, welfare and social democracy. Europe is not perfect,
but has a few lessons to teach about this about how a different society avoids
these problems. No, you can't take them straight

Please take this as a rant. I'm not an expert on education, so I'll listen to

I've read tons of variants of the argument.
