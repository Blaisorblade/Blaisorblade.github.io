This post is about a mere trivia which sounded fun for me.

Time ago I was reading Olin Shivers' excellent [History of T](http://www.paulgraham.com/thist.html), that discusses the story of Orbit, a milestone in optimizing compilers for Scheme (and functional languages more in general). One of the characters is John Lamping, a hacker that after his involvement solved a rather theoretical problem, "optimal lambda reduction": how do you normalize lambda-calculus terms without exponential slowdowns?

Apparently, people who had failed to solve this problem before where rather
annoyed. Shivers mentions in passing a "snooty French paper" that called Lamping
an "autodidact", without citing it. I believe I found
[it](http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/143165.143172), and it's even snootier than I
could have imagined in a paper. Here's the quote:

> Girard is a logician and Lamping is an *autodidactic* engineer. It is no surprise that they never read one another---although they were working on the same problem from different perspectives.
>
> After trying to read Girard's papers on the geometry of interaction, *Lamping’s "An Algorithm for Optimal Lambda Calculus Reduction" sounds like "TV Digest"*. Nevertheless, it seems fair to say that Lamping’s algorithm is rather complicated and obscure.

That's not a blog post, but scientific literature (and thus peer-reviewed), yet the
text seems rather condescending and unprofessional. To be sure: Calling an
algorithm "complicated" and "obscure" is a technical statement about its
mathematical elegance (which, I believe, is a real thing), even if it's hard to
make precise. But the text seems to ridicule Lamping's paper (by comparing it to
"TV Digest") for being easier to read.

Luckily, at least I do not come across such text nowadays; maybe they exist and
I don't see them. But otherwise, either authors who try get rejected, or they
don't even try because they know better. Luckily, our scientific discourse is
getting more civilized.
