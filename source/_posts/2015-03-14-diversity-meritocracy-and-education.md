I've written this post because the ongoing debate between diversity and
meritocracy (especially in tech) seems to focus on short-term solutions, instead
of going to the root of the problem: Merit follows education and, in the US,
education follows privilege. Instead, education should help those who lack
privilege!

### Introduction

According to meritocracy proponents, people who merit should succeed. In practice,
meritocracy requires measuring performance, but that is hard; many believe that
performance is easier to measure in the tech community.

According to diversity proponents, people should have equal opportunities to
succeed, but they don't. Diversity proponents point out that things like race
and gender affect your opportunities: being a rich white man is a privilege in
everything you do.

Meritocracy proponents clash nowadays with diversity proponents: the former
claim that success follows merit, the latter claim that success follows
privilege. The debate even questioned some notions of merit (like the "10x
engineer myth"). Who's right?

### Punchline

Reading
[The Economist](http://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21640316-children-rich-and-powerful-are-increasingly-well-suited-earning-wealth-and-power)
suggests an interesting answer: ***both are right, because education fails to
reduce privilege***. That is, success follows both merit and privilege, because
(among other reasons) merit often follows privilege! But not because of some
intrinsic superiority, but because merit causally follows education[^meritEducationCite]
and education follows privilege.[^otherReasons] I'm oversimplifying a bit on
purpose: Follow footnotes if that bothers you.[^footnotes]

### Elaboration

More specifically, in lots of the United States *public* education utterly fails
to reduce privilege. Quoting
[the same article](http://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21640316-children-rich-and-powerful-are-increasingly-well-suited-earning-wealth-and-power):

> [United States are] unusual in funding [their] public schools through property
> taxes.

Essentially, in the US, the richer you are, the more money is spent on educating
your children, thus[^moneyEducation] the better your children are educated.

On the other hand, the poorer you are are, the more money *should* be spent on
educating your children, to help them catch up. Enough money is not sufficient
for good schools (you also need good teachers), but some is
necessary.[^goodTeacher].

### Outside of the US

The previous discussion was specific to the US, but the US case matters
especially because the debate often focuses on Silicon Valley.

Even outside the US, where funding for education is less broken, education is
still hard---both in general, and for computer science in particular. A
spectacular example was a
[retracted](http://www.eis.mdx.ac.uk/staffpages/r_bornat/papers/camel_hump_retraction.pdf)
draft claiming that programming ability can't be taught to all students; the
authors still claim weaker results, but admit, though, that their result might
be affected "at least by cultural environment and educational practices".
Alternatively, it's not well-known how to teach programming effectively, but
[some](http://www.bootstrapworld.org/)
[actually](http://www.programbydesign.org/) [try](http://www.deinprogramm.de/)
and AFAIK get much better results.

### Is this really not discussed?

To be fair: the debate does
[mention](http://glenngillen.com/thoughts/on-meritocracy)
[education](http://www.ashedryden.com/blog/the-ethics-of-unpaid-labor-and-the-oss-community#bonus),
but they mention "hey, I was lucky to go to a good school", or focus on adult
education. While that's immediately accessible and helps who is already out of
school, we should also think of the next generations. Moreover, early education
can help more, if nothing else because the earlier you learn to
learn[^learnlearn], the more you learn (like with compound interests).

Finally, [this infographic](http://code.org/stats) gets closest: they suggest
that, to have enough programmers, school should allow studying computer science.
That's also true,

### Assumptions

I'll mention here the most debatable of my implicit assumptions. Each has been debated  would
deserve a blog post of its own

* Education can work as advertised
* You can be smart and still not get something

### But do smart people need good teachers?

Good teachers make people smarter and more knowledgeable than they would be
otherwise. Some people might be smart enough anyway, but we don't have enough of
them.

For many, programming is something that you learn on your own, not something you
need be taught; especially, a professional programmer should be good at
learning. However, learning ability is also taught at school.

Some meritocracy proponents might claim to have succeeded thanks only to their
own forces, not because of teachers. However, a good teacher 
That's possible
but hard. and maybe it is a
form of merit by itself. That's also irrelevant:

[^toSomeExtent]: I'll leave "to some extent" implicit after this point. This is
a social science topic, 
Since we're discussing people, that's the only way
something can follow something else.

[^otherReasons]: There are tons of other reasons---measuring performance is
hard, and the actual metrics can be gamed, so success can also follow from
privilege without (too much) merit. But IMHO, meritocracy proponents and
diversity proponents clash with each other because they ignore this point.

[^meritEducationCite]: Not everybody agrees that good teachers can make you
better, IMHO also because many don't experience good teachers. For now, I'll
just assume the link between good teachers and ability, I might provide
evidence.

[^footnotes]: All the points in this reasoning are subject to debate,
exceptions, remarks, but I don't want precision to obscure clarity. Whenever I
say "A follows B", I mean "A correlates with B, and there's causation from B to
A", not "A follows B in 100% of the cases"---the latter thing doesn't happen in
social phenomena, such as the ones we're discussing. Since causation is to some
extent transitive, the reasoning makes sense.

[^goodTeacher]: (Warning: slightly NSFW link) One random example of a good
teacher, turning a bad student into a good one, is Professor Firch in
[this wonderful story](https://medium.com/human-parts/sex-on-wednesdays-e6aabe309fed)
(that also includes other teaching).

[^learnlearn]: Yes, even that's a thing. I've observed multiple times colleagues
in my university struggling because earlier schools failed in teaching them.
