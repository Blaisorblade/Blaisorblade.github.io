Welcome to my new blog! I am a PhD student in Programming Languages, and my blog will focus on programming, programming languages (especially Scala and Haskell) and [my research interest](/about/#research-interests).

After [my last blog](http://blaisorbladeprog.blogspot.com), I've finally decided
to start blogging again. I've finally decided to switch to a Jekyll-style
workflow (courtesy of Octopress).
