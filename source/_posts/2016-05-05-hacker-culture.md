I used to think all decent programmers should be hackers and learn the
Linux/Unix command-line. On their own. Or they were stupid lusers. That was the
time I breathed hacker culture.

Turns out, smart programmers are much more diverse than hackers. Only addressing
hackers means excluding lots of
["highly-capable and motivated"][guoBullshittery] people who just
["just didn't happen to spend 10,000 hours of their youth wrestling with nasty command-line interfaces"][guoBullshittery]. And somehow,






Worse, some smart programmers have

Turns out, that belief causes part of the diversity problems in Computer Science.

But over time I realized
Then I met some genius programmers who couldn't use Linux.

Then I met geniuses using Windows.



Imagine some users don't get your docs. Is it their fault? Are they stupid? Or is there a chance they are smart but your docs are overly frustrating, even though a Unix geek finds no fault with them?

Imagine some users don't get bash. Is it their fault? Are they stupid? Or is there a chance they are smart but learning `bash` has an insanely steep learning curve (for what it is)?
