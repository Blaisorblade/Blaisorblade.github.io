title: Formal Semantics as a Language Designer’s Toolbox ─ A case for semantics-inspired language design
---
# Introduction

This is the homepage for our *Formal Semantics as a Language Designer’s Toolbox --- A case for semantics-inspired language design* abstract and relevant project.

# Talks
  - [Formal Semantics as a Language Designer’s Toolbox --- A case for semantics-inspired language design](Abstract-submitted.pdf) (updated version). With Klaus Ostermann, Tillmann Rendel and Eric Walkingshaw. We are at DSLDI '14.

    **Abstract**:

    With the rise of domain-specific languages, more people are designing languages
    than ever, but the art of language design is hard to master. In this talk, we
    make a case for adapting insights from formal semantics into design patterns and
    conceptual tools for language design.

    Semanticists have invested significant effort in developing these insights in
    the pursuit of mathematical elegance, indirectly providing us with a toolbox
    full of design tools that are simple and powerful. We will introduce a few of
    these design tools, illustrating how language designers can start applying
    insights from formal semantics right now, without being experts in the subject
    or incurring the overhead of formalizing their entire language. The design tools
    we present are just a starting point and we hope to inspire other language
    designers to adapt this utilitarian view of formal semantics, to help us reuse
    the effort and expertise of semanticists by adapting their insights into easily
    applied design tools.
